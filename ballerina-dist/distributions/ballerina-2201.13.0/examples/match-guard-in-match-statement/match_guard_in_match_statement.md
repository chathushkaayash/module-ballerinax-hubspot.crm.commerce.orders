# Match guard in `match` statement

A match-guard is an expression that is used in a `match` clause to determine whether the clause should be executed. A `match` clause will only be executed if its match-guard evaluates to true.

A function call is only allowed with an expression in a match-guard when there is no possibility that it can mutate the value being matched.
