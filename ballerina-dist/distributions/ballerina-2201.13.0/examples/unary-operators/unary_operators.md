# Unary operators

Ballerina supports unary operators that perform operations on a single operand. The unary `-` operator negates the value of a numeric type by changing its sign. The unary `+` operator returns the value of its numeric operand. The `~` operator inverts the bits of an integer, flipping each 0 to 1 and each 1 to 0.

For boolean values, the `!` operator inverts the boolean value, changing `true` to `false` and `false` to `true`.
