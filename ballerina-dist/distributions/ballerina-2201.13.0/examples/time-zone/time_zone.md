# Time Zone

The Ballerina `time` library provides APIs for managing and converting time across different time zones. It supports loading system time zone, retrieving specific time zones based on the time zone ID, and enables seamless conversion between UTC and local times across different regions.

For more information on the underlying module, see the [`time` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/time/latest/).
