# Client class

The `client` keyword is used with class definition to define a client class. Ballerina supports defining client objects to allow a program to interact with remote network services. They are a special kind of object that contain `remote` and `resource` methods in addition to regular methods.

Similarly, class objects can be constructed using an object constructor as well.

## Prerequisites
- Run the HTTP service given in the [Basic REST service](/learn/by-example/http-basic-rest-service/) example.

::: code client_class.bal :::

Run the client program by executing the following command.

::: out client_class.out :::
