# Table types

A `table` is a collection of records in which each record represents a row of the `table`. Each row of the `table` is uniquely identified by a key. This key must be immutable and each rowâ€™s key is stored in its fields.
Compared to maps,
- the key is part of the value rather than being separate.
- the type of the key is not restricted to string.
- the order of the members is preserved.
