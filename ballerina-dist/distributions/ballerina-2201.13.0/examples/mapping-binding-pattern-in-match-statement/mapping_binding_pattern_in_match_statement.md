# Mapping binding pattern in match statement

Mapping binding patterns can be used in a match statement to bind parts of successfully matched mapping values to variables. The rest binding pattern (`...r`) can be used in the mapping binding pattern to bind mapping fields that are not explicitly bound in the binding pattern. This is particularly useful when working with open records.
