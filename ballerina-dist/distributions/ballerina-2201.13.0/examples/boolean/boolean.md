# Boolean

The `boolean` type has two values: `true`, `false`. The `!` operator works on booleans only.  `&&` and `||` operators short-circuit - the second operand is not evaluated if the result of evaluating the first operand is sufficient to identify the result of the logical expression. Usual comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`) produce boolean values.
