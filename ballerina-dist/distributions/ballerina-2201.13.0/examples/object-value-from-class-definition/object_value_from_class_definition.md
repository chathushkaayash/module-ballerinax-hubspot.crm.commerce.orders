# Object value from class definition

A `class` defines an object type and provides a way to construct an object value.  An object can be constructed from the `class` definition using the implicit and explicit `new` expression. The type of the constructor should be mentioned after `new` for the explicit new expression. For the implicit new expression, the type will be inferred from the expected type.
